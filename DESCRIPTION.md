A comprehensive .NET library suite for building desktop applications with Dear ImGui. Provides application scaffolding with PID-controlled frame limiting, custom widgets (TabPanel, SearchBox, Knob, RadialProgressBar, DividerContainer, Grid), modal dialogs (file browser, input prompts, searchable lists), a theming system with 50+ built-in themes and scoped styling, and an attribute-based node graph editor with physics-based layout. Built on Hexa.NET.ImGui bindings and Silk.NET for cross-platform windowing.
