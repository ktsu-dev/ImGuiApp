## v2.1.4 (patch)

Changes since v2.1.3:

- Enhance window position validation logic: Implemented performance optimizations to skip unnecessary checks when window position and size remain unchanged. Added methods for better multi-monitor support, ensuring windows are relocated when insufficiently visible. Updated tests to verify new behavior and performance improvements.
